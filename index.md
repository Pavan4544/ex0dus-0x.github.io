I'm a security researcher passionate about vulnerabilities, reverse engineering and architecting systems for security and privacy.

Professionally, I've worked with both big and small security organizations on threat and vulnerability research, including building effective static/dynamic analysis tools, and automating binary reverse engineering at scale. I currently work at [Trail of Bits](https://trailofbits.com).

I also [disclose](https://bugcrowd.com/ex0dus-0x) [vulnerabilities](http://hackerone.com/ex0dus-0x) through bug bounties sometimes.
